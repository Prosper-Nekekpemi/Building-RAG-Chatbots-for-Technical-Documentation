# Building-RAG-Chatbots-for-Technical-Documentation

This project demonstrates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external data sources (car manuals) using LangChain and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create a context-aware chatbot. The chatbot is designed to help drivers interpret and respond to car dashboard warning messages in real-time.

The proof of concept is aimed at a well-known car manufacturer, where the chatbot provides technical guidance based on a car manual stored as an HTML document. The final goal is to deploy this chatbot in vehicles, allowing it to answer driver queries about warnings and even provide voice-based responses with text-to-speech integration.
